Who worked on what:

Jieni: Beat simple player, score counting, minimax, improvements to alpha beta proving.

Sarah: Beat Simple player, Alpha beta pruning, improvements to minimax.

Tournament Worthy:

To make it tournament worthy we introduced alpha beta pruning to our minimax function, both of which we wrote this week. The
alpha beta pruning is experiencing some hiccups, but it enables us to search deeper levels in less time, and so we can choose the
move that will result in us having the best score. We think that this strategy will allow us to better in the tournament because
we can look farther ahead into the game and make a more strategic move than we could before.
